## Explore gene expression in TCGA AML patients with different mutations.

### Before Starting

For the app to work you will need to clone the repo using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/mmingay2/tcga_aml.git`

Once this is done navigate to the repo with: 

`cd tcga_aml`

Then, from RStudio open the app.R file:

![open file](https://github.com/mmingay2/tcga_aml/blob/master/img/openfile.png "Open File")

Then click the "run app" button in the top right hand corner to see the app in action!

![run app](https://github.com/mmingay2/tcga_aml/blob/master/img/runapp.png "Run App")


Make sure you have [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) the proper libraries installed! These are listed and loaded on lines 1-9 in the `app.R` file. 

For example, one could install the package `dplyr` by running `install.packages("dplyr")` from RStudio's console.
