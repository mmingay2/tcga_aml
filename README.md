# tcga_aml
## Explore gene expression in TCGA AML patients with different mutations.

### Before Starting

For the app to work you will need to clone the repo, navigate to the repo and then unzip the rnamelt dataset using the following command:

`gzip -d ./rnamelt.txt.gz` 

Once this is done you can open the app.R file in RStudio:

Then click the "run app" button in the top right hand corner to see the app in action!

Make sure you have [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) the proper libraries installed! These loaded on lines 1-9 in the `app.R` file. 

For example one could install the package `dplyr` by running `install.packages("dplyr")` in RStudio.
