## Explore gene expression in TCGA AML patients with different mutations.

### Before Starting

For the app to work you will need to clone the repo, navigate to the repo and then unzip the rnamelt dataset using the following command:

`gzip -d ./rnamelt.txt.gz` 

Once this is done you can open the app.R file in RStudio and click the "run app" button in the top right hand corner to see the app in action!
